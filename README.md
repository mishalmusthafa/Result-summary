### Links

## My process
I Have created the webpage using the sass. This was a little challanging for me, especially the making the mobile friendly part. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass


### What I learned

What i have learned from this challange is that if we add the 100vh for the content. if we make it to the responsive mobile, only the center part of the content will be seen. I have created 2 1fr grid container, the 100 vh was fine for the computer view but while switching to mobile view the content was kind of overlapping. So i changed the hieght of the container from the 100vh to 100% in the media quiry.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  padding: 80px 20px;
  background: #fff;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

@media (max-width:600px) {

  // making the grid box to 1fr 
  .item-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }

 //changing the container height from 100vh to 100%
  .container {
    height: 100%;
  }
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
